ITTC Fabric Script (ittc-fabric)
================

## Description

Fabric script for managing ITTC infrastructure.

### CyberGIS
The Humanitarian Information Unit has been developing a sophisticated geographic computing infrastructure referred to as the CyberGIS. The CyberGIS provides highly available, scalable, reliable, and timely geospatial services capable of supporting multiple concurrent projects.  The CyberGIS relies on primarily open source projects, such as PostGIS, GeoServer, GDAL, GeoGit, OGR, and OpenLayers.  The name CyberGIS is dervied from the term geospatial cyberinfrastructure.

### Imagery to the Crowd
The Imagery to the Crowd Initiative (ITTC) is a core initiative of the Humanitarian Information Unit.  Through ITTC, HIU publishes high-resolution commercial satellite imagery, purchased by the United States Government, in a web-based format that can be easily mapped by volunteers.  These imagery services are used by volunteers to add baseline geographic data into OpenStreetMap, such as roads and buildings.  The imagery processing pipeline is built from opensource applications, such as TileCache and GeoServer.  All tools developed by HIU for ITTC, are also open source, such as this repo.

## Installation

Follow directions at http://www.fabfile.org/installing.html to install fabric.  On Ubuntu you can most easily run, `sudo apt-get install fabric`.

Create a `servers.py` file in the same directory as the `fabfile.py`.  `servers.py` is in `.gitignore` so will not be committed.  This file includes connection and other information, so that fab commands are streamlined.

```javascript
IITC = {
    "frontdoor": {
        "ident":  "~/auth/keys/frontdoor.pem",
        "host": "frontdoor.example.com",
        "user": "ubuntu"
    },
    "tilejet": {
        "ident":  "~/auth/keys/tilejet.pem",
        "host": "tilejet.example.com",
        "user": "ubuntu"
    },
    "tileserver_frontend": {
        "ident":  "~/auth/keys/tileserver-frontend.pem",
        "host": "tileserver-frontend.example.com",
        "user": "ubuntu"
    },
    "tileserver_backend": {
        "ident":  "~/auth/keys/tileserver-backend.pem",
        "host": "tileserver-backend.example.com",
        "user": "ubuntu"
    }
}
```

### AWS

If you'd like to receive notifications after tasks are completed via AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS), you need to create a `aws.py` file in the same directory as below.

```
AWS_SETTINGS = {
    "security": {
        "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "XXX",
        "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "XXX+XXX"
    },
    "topics": {
        "test":"arn:aws:sns:us-XXX-X:XXX:XXX"
    }
}
```

## Usage

Cd into the main directory with the `fabfile.py`.  When you call fab, start with the name of the server (frontdoor, tilejet, tileserver_frontend, and tileserver_backend) so that the host and identity key are loaded automatically from `servers.py`.

To see a list of tasks run:

```
fab -l
```

To see the long description of a task run:

```
fab -d taskname
```

A few examples:

```
fab frontdoor restart_nginx
fab tilejet restart
fab tileserver_frontend add_cache
fab tileserver_frontend restart_apache
fab tileserver_backend restart_geoserver
```
